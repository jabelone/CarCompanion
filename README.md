An arduino car companion that can add multiple features to older cars normally only found on new ones!  Documentation coming soon.

You can find all the arduino code in the folder "CarCompanion".  The companion app is created using MIT app inventor and can be found in the folder "CarCompanionApp".

New features to be added (in no particuar order):
- Remote start
- Manual buttons in dash/door for lock/unlock

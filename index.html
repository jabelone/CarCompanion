<p>Car Companion will soon be your favourite thing if you have an older car.  This arduino based companion will add heaps of cool features like proximity unlock and dusk sensing headlights.  It's simple to use and will eventually become full of features.  Automatic proximity unlocking and dusk sensing headlights are just the beginning.</p>

<p>Car Companion is in it's infancy, we're just starting to develop some of the core features in both the software and hardware.  It is not recommended to use any of our hardware or software just yet.  It has only had very limited testing and may be quite difficult to set-up unless you're an experienced maker.</p>

<h3>
<a id="documentation" class="anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation</h3>

<p>At the moment things are changing quickly.  New features are being added and the UI is evolving so it's hard to keep accurate documentation.  Once the project matures a bit more (hopefully by the 1.0 release of the firmware) we promise to create some really great documentation.  </p>

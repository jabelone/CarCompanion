/*
This is an arduino based "car companion" that can add multiple features to older cars normally only found on new ones! 
Documentation coming soon.

Basic feature list so far:
Auto lock/unlock when phone in/out of range
Manual lock/unlock from phone
Indicators and lights flash on lock/unlock

Future feature list:
Cruise control
Rain sensing wipers
Remote start
Dusk sensing lights
"brake tap button" (for flashing tailgaters without tapping brakes)
Manual lock/unlock button on dash/door and maybe one hidden outside of car
Unlock twice, if the car happns to unlock when you're holding the handle up, unlock again so it actually unlocks.

The official website of sorts is the github page at https://github.com/jabelone/CarCompanion

The Config tab contains all of the user configurable options.
The Functions tab has all of the functions declared. (may be split when many more are added)
The Main tab is where the main code is (setup and loops functions etc)

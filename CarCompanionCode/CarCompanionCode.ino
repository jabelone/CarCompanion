This is an arduino based "car companion" that can add multiple features to 
older cars normally only found on new ones.
Documentation coming soon.

Features that have been implemented so far:
Auto lock/unlock when phone in/out of range
Manual lock/unlock from phone
Blinkers (indicators) flash on lock/unlock
"Break tap button" (for flashing tailgaters without tapping breaks)

Planned feature list (rough order of priority):
Manual lock/unlock button internally
Dusk sensing lights
Rain sensing wipers
Remote/keyless start
Unlock twice, if the car happens to unlock when you're holding the handle up, unlock again so it actually unlocks.
Cruise control (low priority)

The official website of sorts is the github page at https://github.com/jabelone/CarCompanion

The Config tab contains all of the user configurable options.
The Functions tab is where all the "common" functions are declared.
The Main tab is where the main code is (setup and loops functions etc)

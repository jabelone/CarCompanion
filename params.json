  "body": "### Welcome to Car Companion.\r\nCar Companion will soon be your favourite thing if you have an older car.  This arduino based companion will add heaps of cool features like proximity unlock and dusk sensing headlights.  It's simple to use and will eventually become full of features.  Automatic proximity unlocking and dusk sensing headlights are just the beginning.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nPlease go to [this page](http://jabelone.github.io/CarCompanion/download) to download the compiled app or app project files.  You will find everything else in this GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n### Open Source\r\nCar Companion is 100% open source and always will be.

It is not recommended to use any of our hardware or software just yet.  It has only had very limited testing and may be quite difficult to set-up unless you're an experienced maker.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nAt the moment things are changing quickly.  New features are being added and the UI is evolving so it's hard to keep accurate documentation.  Once the project matures a bit more (hopefully by the 1.0 release of the firmware) we promise to create some really great documentation.  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author, and maintainer of this project is @jabelone.
